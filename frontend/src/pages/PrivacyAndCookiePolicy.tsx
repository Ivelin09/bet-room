				</p>
				<Title>– Essential cookies</Title>
				<p>
					Essential cookies are necessary for our website to work
					effectively. They help make the website usable by enabling
					basic functionalities such as page navigation and access to
					secure areas of the website. This type of cookies may be
					used to protect and accelerate our website by automatically
					optimizing the delivery of our content. This is how you get
					the fastest page load times and best performance. Also,
					essential cookies may be used for security reasons and to
					identify our trusted visitors. They may filter bots and
					distinguish them from legitimate users, preventing any form
					of spam activity on our website.
				</p>
				<p>
					These cookies do not correspond to any user ID, nor do the
					cookies store any personally identifiable information. We
					advise you to not switch off these cookies. If you set your
					browser to block or alert you about these cookies, please be
					aware that after doing so, some parts of the webpage may not
					work.
				</p>
				<Title>– Functionality cookies</Title>
				<p>
					Preference cookies enable a website to remember information
					that changes the way the website behaves or looks, for
					example your user name, language or the region you are in.
					These cookies may also be used to remember changes you have
					made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that
					you can customize. They may also be used to provide services
					you have asked for, such as watching a video, commenting on
					a blog, using a live chat service or forums.
				</p>
				<Title>– Analytical/Performance cookies</Title>
				<p>
					Analytics cookies help website owners to understand how
					visitors interact with websites by collecting and reporting
					information anonymously. We use different analytics cookies
					in order to analyze information about how our website is
					being used. Analytics cookies can process information about
					the number of visitors to the website, where visitors to the
					website came from, the pages they visit, scrolling
					activities, downloads, information about user agent, time
					spent on the website and approximate geo-location of a
					device that you use to access our website. We use this
					information to compile reports that help us to improve the
					website. Reports may be visually presented through heat maps
					and anonymized screen recordings. All data we process by use
					of this type of cookies are presented in an aggregated form
					and/or pseudonymized.
				</p>
				<p>
					We mainly use analytics cookies provided by{' '}

						<strong>Google Analytics</strong>
					</Link>
					. However, please be aware that we may use analytics cookies
					provided by other companies whose services we may also use
					for analytical purposes.
				</p>
				<Title>– Targeting/Advertising cookies</Title>
				<p>
					Targeting cookies are used to track visitors across
					websites. The intention is to display advertisements that
					are relevant and engaging for the individual user. These
					cookies serve to personalize the way we communicate with you
					and help us to evaluate your personal preferences towards
					specific content that we further use to deliver advertising
					material to you corresponding with your preferences. These
					cookies work by uniquely identifying your browser and
					device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will not
					experience targeted advertising and promotion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please be aware that we may use advertising cookies provided
					by other companies. Also, third party cookies (see the
					section below) may be placed by our partners in order to
					promote their products. For example, third party promotional
					activities may include advertisements such as banners or
					interstitial ads.
				</p>
				<Title>– Third party cookies</Title>
				<p>
					Third parties may set cookies when you visit our website.
					Sometimes that is because we have hired the third party to
					provide services on our behalf. In other cases, it is
					because our web pages contain content or advertisements from
					third parties, such as videos, news content or
					advertisements delivered by other advertising networks.
					Because your browser connects to those third parties’ web
					servers to retrieve that content, third parties are able to
					set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect
					information about your online activities across websites or
					online services. Third party tracking cookies may also be
					necessary for the effective use of affiliate links and the
					performance of any affiliate agreements that we have in
					place.

					We are committed to protecting the security of your personal
					information. We use a variety of security technologies and
					procedures to help protect your personal information from
					unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

					your responsibility to ensure the security of your password

					legal obligation to do so or where we have a reasonable
					belief that it is necessary to do so for business or legal
					reasons.
